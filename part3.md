## Part 3

You have decided to add functionality for the general public.

Add users using devise.

#### further

Add a new model for users to "bookmark" your coffees.

(This is a many-to-many relationship- users has many coffees, coffees has many users)

#### further
Add the ability to favorite roasts as well.

On the user's logged in home page (`/`) show them all the roasts they've favorited and the coffees that have that roast.

#### further
Add a 2nd user model for customer (replace the old customer model with a devise model named customer).

Let the customers log in and order coffees from you.

#### further
Restrict the users who can favorite (the general public) from ordering coffees.
